# This file explains the contents of this directory which contains
# supplementary data for the paper "Faster SARS-CoV-2 sequence
# validation and annotation for GenBank using VADR" related to Table
# 1.
#
# =====================================================================
#
# Table 1 shows the number of SARS-CoV-2 GenBank sequences published
# with release dates in each month in 2020 and 2021.
# 
# This directory contains 24 list files, each containing the full list
# of sequences for each of the 24 months.
#
# These lists were obtained on January 19, 2022 from the NCBI Virus
# SARS-CoV-2 interactive dashboard, tabular view: 
# https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/sars-cov-2
# by restricting by 'release date'
#
# The dashboard allows you to download all INSDC accessions, which
# include sequences originally published in GenBank, ENA and DDBJ.
# These were filtered to only those accessions published in GenBank by
# fetching all the sequences using an internal NCBI script that
# fetches sequences and renames them with a 'long form' sequence name
# that includes the GI and the original database, e.g. 
#
# gi|1800242649|gb|MN938385.1|
#
# These sequence files were filtered for sequence names containing
# 'gb' to restrict to only sequences deposited in GenBank.
# 
# The lists in this directory include only the resulting GenBank
# accessions. 
#
# The accession list from NCBI virus can also be split into GenBank vs
# ENA/DDBJ based on the first two letters of the accessions. The
# 1,616,891 GenBank SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Table 1 all begin with
# one of the following two letter prefixes: MN, MT, MW, MZ, OK, OL, OM
# 
# See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/acc_prefix/
# for more information on accession prefixes.
